* Japan – Capture 6 victory cities and hold till end of round.
Player order: Japan – US – China – UK – ANZAC
Turn:
1. Purchase & repair units
* $1 per damage removal of factories. Fix ships for free at naval
bases.  Upgrade factory for $20.
2. Combat move
* Enemy subs / transports don't block movement.
* Only AA guns in destination shoot, and only at planes in combat,
not strategic bombers.
* Factories and bases already provide AA guns.
* Extra move if starting at naval or air base.
* Landing for planes must be planned. No suicide missions.
3. Combat
* Strategic bombing: Fighter escorts (hit on 1) or interceptors (hit on
2). AA fire only targets bombers. Big factories max 20 damage,

* Amphibious assaults: Bombardment limited to # land units, and
doesn't happen if there is sea combat. Hit units can fight back.
Seaborne attackers cannot retreat, others can but must do so
together.
* Normal combat: Only land units capture territories.
4. Non-combat move: Fighter or tactical bomber may land in sea where
you will be placing new carrier. Planes may not land in newly captured
territories.
5. Mobilize new units: Limited to 10 per major factory, 3 per minor. Must
not use newly captured factory. Damage reduces output. May deploy
planes on own carriers. May deploy ships in hostile sea zone. Major
factory on 3+ territories, minor on 2+, never on islands except Australia
and Japan.
6. Collect income: Convoy disruptions in convoy sea zones next to own

Start: Set up according to scenario.
Turn:
1. Command : Play a card.
2. Order : Announce units / leaders to be ordered.
3. Movement: Move ordered units & leaders one by one.
* Unit / leader may only move once per turn.
* May forfeit movement.
* Leader must move with attached unit unless specifically ordered to
detach.  May not detach from square.
* Unit may not move through other units. Leader may move through
another unit or leader.
* Leaderless unit meeting or met by leader must stop (but may battle).
* Normal infantry move 1 and battle. Light infantry move 1 and battle,
OR move 2.
* Light cavalry move up to 3 and battle. Heavy cavalry move up to 2
and battle.
* Foot artillery move 1, OR battle. Horse artillery move 1 and battle,
OR move 2.
* Leader move up to 3. May retreat voluntarily. Never battles by
himself. May move through enemy if escaping, but enemy melee
attacks, killing on saber.
4. Combat: Ordered units battle one by one.
* May forfeit combat.
* Usually, # dice = # blocks of attacking unit.
* Ranged combat (infantry & artillery) – Must be in range and have line
of sight. Must not be adjacent. If adjacent to another enemy unit, may
only melee combat this unit.
* If firing after movement, half # dice. Artillery # dice  also depends
on distance.
* Score hit if die roll matches target unit.
* May not fire on lone leader, but if leader with a hit unit, roll for
leader casualty.
* Flag may cause retreat.
* Melee combat (all units) – must be adjacent.
* Sequence:
i. Cavalry targeted by infantry may Retire and Reform, which
needs 2 spaces ignoring terrain (except impassable). Attacker
rolls dice and hits on cavalry icons.
ii. Infantry targeted by cavalry may square, during which both
sides max roll 1 die (non cavalry attacks normally). Need 2+
command  cards, 1 to be randomly frozen by attacker. Square
attacks first, and (bounce) flags can never be ignored. Can't
move in square. May unsquare when no adjacent cavalry.
iii. Score hit if die roll matches target unit, or saber. Check
leader casualty.
iv. Flag may cause retreat.
v. Additional actions:
* Take Ground – optional for winning attacker, N/A for square
and artillery.
* Cavalry Breakthrough & Bonus Melee Attack – optional for
winning cavalry attacker. Move 1 more hex after Take
Ground.  Then may Bonus Melee Attack. May Take Ground
after that but no more moves or bonus attacks.
vi. Battle Back if target did not retreat.
* May attack lone leader. Hit on saber, else leader retreats 1 to 3
spaces. Attacker may Take Ground.
* Combined Arms = artillery firing with a melee. Artillery's dice
added to attacking melee unit. May not fire over adjacent friendly
unit even if on hill.
5. Draw new card.
End:
* Achieve enough victory banners according to scenario, usually by
capturing leader or eliminating unit.
Leader casualty check:
* Roll double saber.
* Only 1 check per battle dice roll, e.g. same roll causes both block loss
and unit retreat.
* If attached unit eliminated, single saber kills leader, else leader retreats
1 to 3 spaces.
Retreats:
* 1 hex per flag (3 for militia). Terrain ignored except impassable.
* Retreating unit meeting lone leader stops retreating.
* When unable to retreat, lose blocks. Leader may retreat off board but
not units.
Bolster morale (ignore flags):
* Optional. May partially ignore.
* Situations: (a) Have leader. (b) Supported by 2 friendly units – square
may not receive such support, lone leader may provide support.
* Attacking cavalry may not ignore bounce flag from square infantry.
Others:
* Hexes split by dotted lines are in both sections.
* Leader is not a unit.
* Command is a player's hand size for the scenario. Each unit in square
formation reduces Command by one.
* Refer rules and ref sheets for terrain / unit / card specific rules. Coney Island

th
gear only, and must be lower gear than car in front.
* Can be chained.
* If use slipstream to enter corner, lose 1 brake point, and is not
considered to have done a corner stop.
* Not allowed to brake to benefit from slipstream.
Time trials for determining pole position:
* No penalties except corners. Use stopwatch.
* Final time is # die rolls + minutes real time + corner overshots.
Tiebreaker is minutes real time.
Tyres and weather:
* Different tyre types suitable for different weather.
* Weather roll for time trials – one time only.
* Weather roll for laps. If sunshine or rain, remain for whole race. If
changeable, do weather check whenever a car in 5
th
/6
th
gear rolls
20/30. Only when 2 consecutive sunshine or rain then the
weather stabilises.
* In rain, collision on 1-2 roll, engine damage for 1-3 roll, road
holding on 1-5 roll.
Three lap races:
* 20 points to allocate, min 1 pt per feature.
* New feature – road holding. Lose if no more road holding.
* The space where a car loses body or engine or is eliminated
becomes dangerous. If pass or stop at such a space, roll die, lose
road holding on 1-4.
* New pit stop type, can also refresh body, engine, brake and roadholding. Must wait until next turn to leave, at 4
th
gear or lower.
Formula De
Start:
* Everyone 1
st
gear.
Turn:
* Turn order is position of cars, if tied, higher gear, if tied again
whichever car reached that position earlier.
* Decide gear, roll die, move. If shift gear up max 1 step, if shift
gear down max 4 steps.
Track:
* Corners: Mandatory number of stops in each corner stretch. If
short of 2 or more stops, lose. If short by 1 stop, lose tire wear
points per # spaces overshot. When overshooting, if reach new
corner, do not count as first stop. Must stay in same lane.
* Straights: Max changes 2 lanes in one turn. No zigzag except
passing another car. Must take shortest distance to next corner.
Others:
* Starting race: Roll D20, if 1, lose a turn, if 20, move 4 spaces.
* Spin out: If lose last tire point, spin out. Turn car backwards. Next
turn start at 1
st
gear.
* Braking: Lose brake points to move less.
* Blocking: Need to pay tire & brake points. If cannot, lose. Car in
front hit and lose body point. If more than 1 car can be hit, roll die
to decide.
* Overrev (downshift >1): Lose fuel/brake/engine. If no fuel, cannot
downshift >1. If no brake, cannot downshift >2. If no engine,
cannot downshift > 3.
* Collision: When a car stops behind/beside another, for each
contact both cars roll black die to lose body point on a 1. If lose
all body point, lose. If a car causes other cars to lose, must take 1
body point loss itself.
* Engine damage: When a car in 5
th
/6
th
gear rolls 20/30, everyone
in 5
th
/6
th
gear rolls black die and lose engine point for result of 1-
4.
* Pit stops (>1 lap races only) to refresh tires: Braking, blocking,
overrev, collision, engine damage don't apply. Enter pit in any
gear. Roll black die. If 1-10, divide by 2 round up and move,
consider 4
th
gear. If 11-20, stop a turn and next turn leave at 4
th
gear or lower.  Frank’s Zoo

* Pinning. Same number as enemy blocks pinned. Unpinned blocks may
not cross borders used by attacker.
* Norse movement costs 1 point. Moves from coast to any coast, and
may retreat to any friendly coast. May not enter England.
4. Combat resolution. 1
st
player determines sequence if multiple battles.
* Welsh & Irish. Roll loyalty at battle start. 5/6 – go to replacement pool.
* Max 3 combat rounds, after which attacker must retreat.
* Every combat round, a block may fire, retreat or pass. Defender first.
Apply hits immediately before next player rolls.
* Strength = # of dice. Rating = combat priority & die result to hit.
* If attacking from multiple areas, only 1 group is main attack, others are
reserves which fight starting round 2 (if main attack survives).
Defender reinforcements also are reserves.
* Hit allocation to strongest block. If tied, owner picks.
* Retreat. To friendly or neutral area. Border limits apply per combat
round. May not use borders used by enemy, if same border used by

steps.
* Check wintering limit based on castles and cathedrals, eliminate
unsupplied blocks. Non-noble blocks may be voluntarily returned to
replacement pool.
* Use replacement steps to heal blocks. Scots may use this to draw a
block at strength 1, but must still adhere to block limit. English may
heal infantry or nobles only.

Victory condition (any one):
* US:
* 12 resources worth of Muslim countries have Good governance.
* 15 Muslim countries have Fair+ governance.
* No more Jihadist cells.
* Jihadist:
* 6 resources worth of Muslim countries have Islamist rule, including 2 adjacent.
* US prestige at 1, and 15 Muslim countries have Poor- governance.
* Weapons of Mass Destruction Plot resolved in US without being countered.
* Tiebreaker: US wins if more than twice resources under Good governance than
Islamist rule (incl green Regime Change).
Turn:
* Alternately play 2 cards, starting with Jihadist. Play card for operations value or
event. Each time after US action, resolve all Plots.
* Event:
* May only trigger own side or neutral event.
* Lingering means long-term effect.
* Lapsing means Lingering until end of Turn.
* Operations value:
* Using opponent's card causes his event to happen, except 1
st
Jihadist card
used for Plot each Turn. Active player decides whether event happens first.
* US: ops required depends on governance of target country. If Islamist rule,
may only do Regime Change. Single location.
* Jihadist: ops value determines # of dice, governance is success range.
Multiple locations possible.
a. Reserves. Value 1 or 2 cards only. Reserves may be fully spent later within
same Turn to boost other operations to value 3.
b. (US) War of Ideas.
i. In Muslim country: Try to improve a Neutral's Alignment or an Ally's
Governance. Good govt removes Regime Change, Besieged Regime
and Aid. Success on 5. If Regime Change country, WOI allowed only if
troops > cells by 5. If fail by 1, may place first Aid marker.
ii. Non Muslim country: Change Posture. If result matches US, Prestige +1.
c. (US) Deploy. Move troops from one place to another (incl troops track).
Destination country governance determines ops value, and must be Ally.
i. Regime Change. Need Hard Posture. Target is Islamist rule. Play 3-
value card. Deploy 6+ troops. Place Regime Change marker. Roll
Governance. Alignment becomes Ally. Sleeper cells activated. Roll
Prestige.
ii. Withdraw: Need Soft Posture. Play 3-value card. Withdraw troops from
Regime Change country (disregarding cells). Remove Aid marker. Place
Besieged Regime marker. Roll Prestige.
d. (US) Disrupt. Require Ally, or 2 troops, or non-Muslim. If 2+ troops or
country Posture Hard, affect 2 cells (remove active or activate sleeper),
otherwise 1. If all cells removed, put cadre. If only cadre present, remove.  If
2+ troops, Prestige +1.
e. (US) Alert. Play 3-value card. Reveal and remove 1 Plot. Permanently if
WMD.
f. (US) Reassessment. Play two value-3 cards to change US Posture. No
reserves allowed.
g. (Jihadist)  Recruit: Place sleeper cell in country with cell or cadre. Remove
cadre if any. Auto-success if Regime Change. Some countries need rolling
REC# or lower (ignore governance).
h. (Jihadist)  Travel: Auto-success for adjacent. If succeed, cell sleeps; if fail,
lose cell.
i. (Jihadist)  Jihad: Muslim (except Iran) and non Islamist rule. Need 1 cell per
die roll. Sleeper cell becomes active. Each success worsens Governance
and removes 1 Aid. If cells > troops by 5+ and Jihadist activates all sleeper
cells, 2 successful rolls on a single card shifts from Poor to Islamist Rule.
* Failed roll removes cell.
* If 3 dice rolled for major jihad vs Poor failed, place Besieged Regime
marker, Alignment shift towards Ally. Besieged Regime only needs 1
successful Jihad roll to become Islamist Rule.

Start:
* Board: 10 face-up influence tiles, 7 face-up location tiles.
* Players: 1 face-down special tile, 2 cubes per city, then 2
rounds of placing 1 cube in preferred city.
Structure: (3 turns of 4 phases each)
* (round 2 on) All influence tiles reshuffled before dealt,
previous Athens leader is start player.
* Select influence tile and place cubes. Can assassinate
cube or propose candidate (not necessarily same city as
tile). Refill after selecting. Players take turns to select 5/5/4
tiles for 3/4/5P. Must select different colour if available.
* Propose candidate. Must have own cube in city. Do so until
all 12 candidate spaces are filled.
* Election. Candidate with most cubes win, tiebreaker is
alpha position. Both candidate cubes are removed. Winner
removes additional cubes of same # as loser.
* Commit forces. Sparta controller decides start player. City
controller takes city army, player with no city control takes
Persians. One round of recovering dead units, one per city,
lowest value of type selected.
* All 2-shard tiles are used first, each tile allows 0-2 units to
be committed (can be from different cities and/or to
different locations).
* Units played face-down, can be stacked. Allied units can be
a mix.
* Main attacker/defender must be filled before allies
* May not attack own city's location
* May not defend other city's location w/o permission

not defend B's location or join forces in any battle.
* Same player may never have units on both sides of a
battle.
* May spend 1 cube to send 2 more units
* Resolve battle. Intrinsic defenders always defend, intrinsic
attackers only when there is a main attacker. Consult
combat table for die roll needed to collect battle token.
Stronger side determines best column. Combatants roll 2
dice, and first to collect 2 battle tokens wins. Else roll until
tie broken.
* Loser loses 1 unit, priority main combatant.
* If 2-round combat, winner of 1
st
round starts 2
nd
round with 1
battle token already won.
* Winner takes location tile. If defender loses, place defeat
counter on highest VP square of city.
* If location not attacked, set aside face-up. Main defender
adds 2 cubes to city.
* Surviving units return to city.
* Leaders become monuments. Uncommitted units return to
city.
