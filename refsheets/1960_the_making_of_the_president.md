1960: The Making of The President
=================================

Start:
------

* Kennedy in Massachusetts, Nixon in California.  2 momentum
markers each. 10 cubes each into bag.

General principle: Always need to completely remove opponent's
cubes / markers before adding your own.

Normal Turns:
-------------

1. Initiative phase. Gain cards, 6 before Debates, 7 after. Do initiative check
(draw cubes from bag till 2 cubes of same colour drawn), winner decides who
goes first.
2. 5 activity phases. Options:
    1. Play card as event. Keep as reminder if persistent event, else
    remove from game.
    2. Play card for  Campaign Points (CP), which must be spent on 1
    type of activity:
        1. Campaign in states. Add cubes to state(s) in region where
        candidate is, or move candidate, in any combination.
            * Add cube: Move candidate to state. If opponent present in state
            or carrying state (4+ cubes), need to do support check
            * draw cube(s) from bag and success on own colour, unless having
            media control.
            * Move candidate: 1CP per region border. To/from Alaska/Hawaii
            = crossing regional border.
        2. Advertising in regions. Do support checks to remove opponent cube
        and/or add own cube.
        3. Positioning on issues.  1CP for first cube, 2CP per additional
        cube on same issue.
        4. After use, opponent may spend momentum marker to trigger event. May
        preempt opponent  by spending 2 momentum markers.
    3. Play candidate card. Use 5CP, flip card to exhausted side.
    4. Always collect rest cubes when applicable.
3. Momentum phase.
    * Discard half momentum markers, round down.
    * Gain momentum marker / endorsement card according to issues, resolved
    from 3rd place issue upwards. Endorsement card immediately used.
    * Remove 1 cube from every issue.
    * Player with more media support cubes swaps two issues.
4. Campaign strategy phase.
    * Play 1/2 cards to campaign strategy card stack before/after Debates,
    discard any remaining cards.
    * Move rest cubes to bag.

Debates: (Turn 6)
-----------------

* Initiative phase. Winner will win ties during Debates.
* Collect cards from campaign strategy stack.
* Simultaneously pick and reveal card, then place according to issue icon and
candidate icon.
* An issue is won when there are 2 cards on same side. Winner is candidate with
more CP on that issue. If simultaneous resolution, resolve lower position issue
first.
* Move issue back to board to lowest available position, winner gains 2/3/4
state support cubes.
* If issues unresolved after all cards played, resolve lower position issue
first.

Election Day: (Turn 9)

2 cubes each, all go into bag.
