1989: Dawn of Freedom
=====================

Start:
------

* Players: 8 Early Year cards. Place preset support points, then take turns
placing more – Com 2, Dem 3, Com 3, Dem 4, Com 2, anywhere without opponent
presence.

10 turns:
---------

1. If turn 4/8, shuffle Mid/Late Year cards into draw deck. Draw up to 8 cards.
2. 7 action rounds, Com first.
3. Play card as Event or for Ops (if opponent's event, it occurs, but you
decide when).
    1. Event: * = remove from game if event occurs, underlined = lasting
    effect, red = prerequisite for another event.
    2. Ops – place support: Place 1pt at a time, with or adjacent to existing
    support at start of action. If opponent controlled, costs double Ops.
    3. Ops – support check: Do 2 checks. Target must have opponent support.
    Succeed if die roll + ops value + adjacent controlled – adjacent opponent
    controlled > 2 x stability. Remove opponent support by difference, add own
    if not enough to remove.
    4. Ops – Attempt Tiananmen advance. Event not triggered. Success = Ops
    value + die roll +1 if  own event +1 if 2 nd or more attempt (usually only
    1 allowed) >= requirement. Enjoy award if more advanced than opponent,
    until he catches up.
4. Extra support check. (due to Tiananmen)
5. Celebrate New Year Eve. (game will end)
6. Advance turn marker.
7. Final scoring (after Turn 10).

Power Struggle: (when scoring card played)
------------------------------------------

1. Get 6 cards for first controlled space, 2 for each additional.
2. (optional) Raise stakes by discarding 3 cards. +1 modifier to VP and support
loss die roll. +2 if both raise stakes.
3. Card play. Start with player who played scoring card, who has initiative (is
attacker).
    * Attacker plays a card and defender may match suit, after which defender tries
      to seize initiative (roll >= rank of attacking card).
    * If attacker plays wild card, start new round  with defender becoming
      attacker.
    * May play leader if controlling space of same type.
    * If attacker can't attack, or defender can't / doesn't match, lose.
4. Aftermath. Die roll to determine VP gain and opponent support loss.
Modifiers +2 if won by Rally, -2 if won by Petition. Refer results tables for
effect.
    * If Dem win and VP die roll 4+ (after modifier), Com loses power, remove
      scoring card permanently. Com may voluntarily surrender power.
    * Com scores for Power. VP = country Power value x times scoring card
      played.
5. Scoring.
    * Presence = has control. Domination = control more spaces & control more
    battleground spaces & control at least 1 nonbattleground space. Control
    = control more spaces & control all battleground spaces. Score according to
    table.
    * Score 1VP per battleground space.

End:
----

* Instant win at 20VP (not halfway through Power Struggle, N/A at Final
Scoring).
* Instant win if opponent error in holding scoring card.
* New Year Eve Party. Dem picks a country to do Power Struggle, after which
higher final score wins.
* Final scoring. Score every country. Com scores 4VP per country still in its
Power. Higher final score wins.

Others:
-------

* Non-Scoring card has minimum of 1 Ops value even if penalised.
* See 7.6 for special Romanian events.
