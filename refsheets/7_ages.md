7 Ages
======

(Note: This is a very brief overview and is only sufficient to get you
started. Many details have been omitted. See full rules.)

Start:
------

* 7 cards.
* Simultaneously spend card to determine first player. Highest card goes
first, if tied, tied players spend again.
* In card value order select permanent empires (pair of light & dark).

Round:
------

* Secretly play 1 action marker on each empire in play. May play 1 extra if
not yet reached max empires. Max empires is 5/4/3 for 3/4/5+ players.
* Wild card action: Reveal during desired action. Empire doesn't freeprogress,
lose 1 Glory if perform same action twice.
* Actions:  (resolved in this order, may forfeit own action by not revealing)
    1. Start empire. Play card from hand. Choose own permanent colour if possible.
    Follow restrictions on card. Progress marker offset based on most advanced
    empire. Buy armies / fortification. Get leader & capital.
    2. Production. Income from undisordered areas and cities. Non-fertile wheat
    only Ages 5-7, oil only Age 7. Half income if no capital. Pay $1 per unit
    unless barbarian (i.e. no city). Disband unmaintained units and lose area if no
    unit remaining, or area becomes disordered if other units remain. Pay to build
    max 1 unit per area, more if city present. Naval units can be built on coastal
    land or sea, not ocean. $5 for fortification, not allowed for barbarians.
    3. Trade & progress. Trade with another player's empire within range, priority
    not yet traded; else trade with deck. If both empires chose Trade, both actions
    considered done after 1 trade. In range means steps to partner <= your empire
    age. Cannot count through ocean unless Age 4. Cannot count through others'
    territory unless permitted or paid for.
        * Simultaneously pick card to give, adding empire trade power.
        * Win: progress 1, +1 if chose Trade action, +1 if partner more
        advanced. Tied: lower empire choosing Trade action +1.
        * May give money to partner.
    4. Manoeuvre. Move units. Explorers give +1 move. Note terrain movement cost,
    except to ships & planes. Leaders must be with units. Ships can move/stop on
    coastal land. Ship may carry 1 land or air unit, but must start and end move
    together. If meet enemy units, each enemy pins 2 units. Land or sea units don't
    pin aircraft. Must not vacate land areas of non-aircraft units. Aircraft-only
    area can be vacated.
        * Remove disorder if have enough units: 1 + terrain defense + city
        value (0 if non-archer missile unit)
        * Battles: Draw card & secretly commit unit(s). Strength = card +
        frontline value of half the units + support value of the rest + elite
        marker (max 3) + age advantage + best frontline and support
        value per opponent army disorder + [defender: terrain +
        fortification (2) + city (0 if attacker has non-archer missile)].
        Elephant cancels frontline value of chariot, light horse & horse
        archer, but if lost, must retreat. Round loser loses all committed
        units, if tied both lose. Repeat battle round with uncommitted
        units. If none and need to use tired troops, +1 disorder. May
        retreat if opponent has disorder. Battle loser loses 1 elite, if
        defender remove artifacts & fortification, reduce city; if lose capital
        (or a leader if no capital), lose all money, giving half to winner.
    5. Destiny. Discard any unwanted card(s), draw to 6.
    6. Civilise. Play any number of events, assassinate, artifact, demote
    leader, promote leader, adopt religion/government, modernise unit,
    urbanise (build/upgrade city), remove disorder ($7 each). See rules
    for details.
    7. Discard empire. Remove everything except cities, replace capital
    with normal city.
* Free progress, unless dark age or wild card action used.
* Earn Glory. Note some criteria have 2nd / 3rd place points. Tiebreaker turn
order. Disordered areas are ignored when counting areas. If sea area adjacent
to multiple regions, it counts for each region.
* Pass start player marker.

End:
----

* Most Glory wins, tiebreaker most advanced.

Others:
-------

* Empire can be started more than once.
* Elephants only enter force pool if (a) progress 10 and control elephant area,
or (b) win trade with such an empire. Remove all elephants in Age 7.
* Nukes and star wars units may move anywhere, except nuke cannot enter area
with star wars. During battle, if only nuke uncommitted, may self destruct.
Nuke auto-destroyed by star wars before a battle round if both committed. If
nuked, all units from both sides die. Nuked area owner -1 progress. Nuke user
-5 Glory.
* During battle, even non-involved players may play events.
* Not allowed to examine opponents' units.
* May only use canals if permitted by all controlling empires.
* Empires with no units left are immediately discarded.
* For Optional Rules, see rules.
